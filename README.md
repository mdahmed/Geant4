Codes for XFCT imaging

Code progress:
1. Geometry completed (includes cone beam)
2. The physics list allows to use modular Livermore, Penelope and others.
3. Scores TotalEnergyDeposited, makes histogram and exclues Cd peaks

SHOULD NOT RUN FOR MORE THAN 1e9 particles

Future task:
1. Include input energy spectrum (already impleted in another version)
2. Record input energy spectrum histogram
3. Find alternative to scoring TotalEnergyDeposited to avoid Cd peaks.
4. Implement Phase Space
